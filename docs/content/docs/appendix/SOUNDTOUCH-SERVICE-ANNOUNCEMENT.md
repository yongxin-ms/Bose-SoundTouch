**Date**: February 2026
**Version**: v2.0.0+
**Status**: Production Ready

## What's New?

We're excited to announce the addition of `soundtouch-service`, a comprehensive local server that emulates Bose's cloud services for SoundTouch devices. This major addition provides offline operation capabilities and advanced device management features.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🏠 Complete Service Emulation
- **BMX Services**: Full Bose Media eXchange implementation for TuneIn, podcasts, and media streaming
- **Marge Services**: Account and device management, preset synchronization, recent items tracking
- **Offline Operation**: Continue using your devices without internet connectivity to Bose servers

### 🔧 Device Migration
- **Seamless Migration**: One-click migration from Bose cloud to local services
- **Configuration Backup**: Automatic backup of existing device settings
- **Rollback Support**: Easy restoration to original Bose cloud configuration
- **Migration Preview**: Analyze what will change before applying updates

### 📊 Advanced Debugging
- **Traffic Proxying**: Intercept and log all device communications
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live device event streaming and status tracking
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage statistics and error reporting
- **Debug Tools**: Comprehensive troubleshooting utilities

### 🌐 Web Management Interface
- **Device Dashboard**: Visual overview of all discovered devices
- **Migration Wizard**: Step-by-step guided device configuration
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time device status and event streaming
- **Configuration Viewer**: Inspect and modify device settings

## 🚨 Why This Matters

### Bose Cloud Service Discontinuation
Bose has announced that [SoundTouch cloud support will end on May 6, 2026](https://www.bose.com/soundtouch-end-of-life). This service provides a complete local alternative, ensuring your devices continue to work with full functionality beyond the official support timeline.

### Enhanced Privacy & Control
- **Local Processing**: All data stays on your network
- **No External Dependencies**: Operate completely offline
- **Custom Integrations**: Build your own automation and controls
- **Traffic Visibility**: See exactly what your devices are doing

## 🛠️ Installation & Quick Start

### Install
```bash
go install github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch/cmd/soundtouch-service@latest
```

### Run
```bash
soundtouch-service
```

### Access Web UI
Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and start managing your devices!

## 📖 Implementation Credits

This service implementation builds upon excellent community work:

### 🍾 SoundCork Foundation
Our implementation is heavily inspired by and based on [SoundCork](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork) by Deborah Gu and contributors. SoundCork pioneered the approach of intercepting Bose's cloud services and provided the architectural foundation for offline SoundTouch operation.

**Key contributions from SoundCork:**
- Service emulation architecture
- BMX/Marge endpoint discovery
- Device migration strategies
- Python implementation reference

### 🎵 ÜberBöse API Insights
[ÜberBöse API](https://github.com/julius-d/ueberboese-api) by Julius D. provided valuable insights into advanced SoundTouch API endpoints, helping make our implementation more complete and robust.

### 🏠 SoundTouch Plus Documentation
The [SoundTouch Plus Wiki](https://github.com/thlucas1/homeassistantcomponent_soundtouchplus/wiki/SoundTouch-WebServices-API) provided comprehensive API documentation that enabled many of the advanced features.

## 🔄 What's Different in Our Go Implementation

While inspired by SoundCork's Python implementation, our Go service offers:

### Performance & Efficiency
- **Native Compilation**: Single binary deployment with no runtime dependencies
- **Low Resource Usage**: ~50MB memory footprint vs Python's higher overhead
- **Concurrent Processing**: Go's goroutines enable efficient concurrent device handling
- **Fast Startup**: Sub-second service startup time

### Enhanced Features
- **Web Management UI**: Built-in browser-based interface (SoundCork is API-only)
- **Real-time Event Streaming**: WebSocket-based live device monitoring
- **Advanced Migration Tools**: Migration preview and rollback capabilities
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with multiple output formats

### Production Readiness
- **Zero Dependencies**: Single binary with embedded web UI
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux support out of the box
- **Docker Ready**: Containerization support (planned)
- **Monitoring Integration**: Health checks and metrics endpoints

### Developer Experience
- **Go Ecosystem**: Integrates with existing Go applications and infrastructure
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checks and robust error handling
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and examples
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage with real device validation

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Home Automation Enthusiasts
```bash
# Migrate all devices and integrate with Home Assistant
soundtouch-service
# Configure HA to use local service endpoints
```

### Developers & Integrators
```go
// Build custom applications on top of local services
client := &http.Client{}
resp, _ := client.Get("http://localhost:8000/setup/devices")
```

### Privacy-Conscious Users
```bash
# Run completely offline with full device functionality
soundtouch-service --bind 127.0.0.1  # localhost only
```

### Network Administrators
```bash
# Monitor and log all device traffic
LOG_PROXY_BODY=true soundtouch-service
```

## 🚀 Future Plans

- **Docker Images**: Official container images for easy deployment
- **Cluster Support**: Multi-instance deployment for high availability
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-powered usage insights
- **Extended Protocol Support**: Additional Bose protocol implementations
- **Mobile App**: Companion mobile application for device management
