title: "Bose SoundTouch Telnet (Port 17000) Command Reference"
---
A consolidated reference for the diagnostic shell that listens on TCP port
17000 across the SoundTouch line. Compiled from multiple community sources
to give a single map of what's been observed in the wild — useful both for
implementing automation against it (see
[TELNET-MIGRATION-METHOD.md](TELNET-MIGRATION-METHOD.md)) and for manual
recovery / WiFi setup.

> **Important caveat.** The command set is firmware-dependent. Anything that
> existed in firmware 1.x–7.x (`flarn2006`'s era) was progressively trimmed;
> some commands listed here have been removed on firmware 27.x. Where a
> command's availability is known to vary, the **Availability** column says so.

### Telnet via Docker (when not installed locally)

```shell
docker run --rm --name telnet -it --env IP=192.0.2.123 alpine:edge ash -c 'apk add -U busybox-extras && telnet $IP 17000'
```

## Connecting to the shell

### From an already-on-network device

The shell binds to TCP port 17000 on every device family observed (ST 10/20/300, Wave III/IV, ST 520, SA-5 — see §"Firmware era notes" for caveats). No authentication.

```bash
# A no-op probe just to verify reach.
echo '' | nc -w 2 <device-ip> 17000

# Or interactively — works the same.
telnet <device-ip> 17000
```

The `bose` script (S4) goes one level lower and writes commands directly to a `/dev/tcp/<ip>/17000` redirection target instead of using `nc`. That's the same wire protocol with no library between.

### From a factory-fresh / WiFi-less device

Per S2/S3 — newer firmware may have closed this on some models:

1. **Enter setup mode.** Press and hold key **2** + **volume down** for 5 seconds until the WiFi LED turns amber.
2. **Connect your laptop to the speaker's open access point.** The speaker becomes its own AP.
3. **Telnet to `192.0.2.1` on port 17000.**

Once you've added a WiFi profile (see `network wifi profiles add` below) the speaker reboots into station mode and the AP goes away.

### Hardware key combinations on the device itself

**Example session — adding a network from setup mode (S3):**

```
network wifi profiles add foobarHub wpa_or_wpa2 topsecret
```

The speaker stores the profile, drops the setup AP, and reboots into station mode.

## The `key` family — front-panel button emulation

Each `key …` command emulates a press of a physical button on the speaker
or remote. Confirmed working on ST 10 / FW `27.0.6.46330.5043500` (S5);
also visible on the ST 20/300/Wave captures in #221. Different from the
`sys presetkey N p` form (S4) — the `key prefix_N` shape on FW 27 is what
the device's own remote sends.

| `key power`                     | Echoes "OK" but no observable effect on FW 27.x — possibly handled at a higher layer. On Lifestyle/CineMate console devices this is **not** a no-op: it puts the console into standby and, on waking, returns it to the console's own input rather than SoundTouch — see [Lifestyle / Console Device Behavior](../guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#lifestyle-console-devices) and #597. | S5     |

The S4 `bose` script's `sys presetkey N p` form still works, but `key prefix_N` is shorter and matches what the remote already does on FW 27.x.

## The `sys` family — system control & service URLs

The `sys` family is the one our migration uses (see §"What we use during migration"). Two distinct sub-syntaxes coexist:

- **Single-token verbs:** `sys reboot`, `sys volume`, `sys power`, etc.
- **`sys configuration <key> <value>` setters** that modify persisted runtime configuration. Used for the four service URLs (margeServerUrl, statsServerUrl, swUpdateUrl, bmxRegistryUrl).

Each `sys configuration` setter is reported by users to return `OK` on success. Wait for that token between commands (S6, `foob61451`).

## The `envswitch` family — parallel persistence layer

`envswitch` writes to a separate, lower-level persistence store that **wins on next reboot** if the corresponding `sys configuration` value differs. So our migration writes both — see TELNET-MIGRATION-METHOD.md §2.1.

**It's a commit point, not just a two-field setter.** `envswitch boseurls set` persists whatever is currently in the runtime layer at the moment it runs — not only its own two arguments. Confirmed on five variants (`lisa`, `mojo`, `spotty`, `ginger`, `taigan`; [#515 comment 5231931569](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5231931569)): a `sys configuration` write survives a reboot **if and only if** an `envswitch boseurls set` runs after it. The same command sequence in reverse order silently loses the later `sys configuration` values on reboot — every command still answers, nothing looks wrong until the reboot. This is why our migration and SSH-enable sequences always issue all four `sys configuration` writes first and `envswitch boseurls set` last (see `telnetURLs.Commands()` / `EnableSSHViaTelnetFullConfig`).

**It does not acknowledge with `OK`.** Unlike `sys configuration` (which does), `envswitch boseurls set` responds with a different string (observed: `Setting Bose Server URLs to <a> and <b> ->`, no `OK` substring). An implementation that waits for the literal token `OK` will hit its own timeout on this exact command. Our `pkg/telnet.Client.SendCommand` doesn't string-match at all — it reads until the connection goes idle — so this only matters if you're hand-typing the sequence or reimplementing the client elsewhere.

| `envswitch boseurls set <margeUrl> <swUpdateUrl>`                 | Persist the marge and update URLs, committing the runtime layer as it stands (see above). **Two arguments**, in that order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | S6      |

Used as fallback in our `PairAccount` helper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | S6      |
| `envswitch accountid get`, bare `envswitch`, `envswitch boseurls` | **Confirmed unsupported** — all answer `Invalid Command Option` on `lisa`/`mojo`/`spotty` ([#515 comment 5231931569](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5231931569)). `envswitch` has no read form on any variant tested; the persisted layer can only be written, then observed indirectly after a reboot (e.g. via `getpdo`, which then reflects the *new* value). | (probe) |

## The `getpdo` family — read persisted configuration

`getpdo <selector>` prints the contents of a persisted-data-object. We use it as the verification step after writing URLs.

| Selector                            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                               | Source |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `getpdo CurrentSystemConfiguration` | Echoes the resolved URL set, including margeServerUrl/bmxRegistryUrl/statsServerUrl/swUpdateUrl. We grep our targetURL out of this to confirm a successful migration. | S6     |

**The two layers are inverted in `getpdo` visibility around a reboot** ([#515 comment 5231931569](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5231931569)): *before* a reboot, `getpdo` shows the runtime (`sys configuration`) values immediately, while an `envswitch`-written value isn't visible yet; *after* a reboot, the `sys configuration` values are gone and the `envswitch`-persisted values are what's now applied. So a `getpdo` check run before rebooting confirms the writes were accepted, but it is **not** evidence the configuration will survive the reboot — only the `envswitch` write (in the right order, see above) determines that. This is why our own migration verification (`migrateViaTelnet`) checks `getpdo` before reboot only to confirm the runtime layer accepted the values, and never claims persistence from it.

| `scm restart <service>` | Restart a service by name.                                                               | Older firmware | S1                                                                           |

## Shell-unlock commands

These are the commands that gated SSH access on older firmware. Both have been progressively removed; on FW 27.x they generally do nothing useful.

| `local_services on`         | Alternative enablement; works on some firmware where `remote_services` was removed. SA-5 FW 9.x reports `local services on`, but this alone does not appear to grant SSH on most models. | Old, hit-or-miss | S1, [deborahgu/soundcork#141](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues/141) |
| `demo enter` / `mode enter` | Unlocks demo / button-test mode (used historically to recover bricked units).                                                                                                            | Old              | S1                                                                               |

## `help`

Lists the commands available on the running firmware. **Frequently removed** on later firmware — returns `Command not found` on FW 27.x in many of the captures we have. Still worth probing once during preflight: a successful response is a quick way to enumerate what this specific build supports without trial-and-error.

These show up in `getpdo`, `network status`, and SSH-side hostnames. Useful for matching captures to hardware.

## Firmware era notes

- **Firmware 1.x–7.x** (S1 era): everything — `help`, `remote_services on`, full `scm`, and an in-shell login prompt. `flarn2006` documents the original Linux insides.
- **Firmware 8.x–14.x** (S2 era): `remote_services on` removed; `network`, `sys`, `envswitch`, `getpdo` still present. `local_services on` works on some Wave/SA-5 models.
- **Firmware 27.x** (S5/S6 era — the long-lived "frozen" build that survived through EOS): `help`, `remote_services on`, and `sys ver` removed in some builds; `sys configuration …` and `envswitch …` confirmed working on ST 10, ST 20, ST 300, Wave III, Wave IV. **This is the firmware our migration targets**. The Portable on more recent firmware drops further commands and is the hardest target; on the ST Portable (Series I, FW `27.0.6.46330.5043500`) and some CineMate 520 units the SSH-enable injection persists but `sshd` does not start via the default path, which is what `setup enable-ssh --full-config` addresses (see "What we use to enable SSH" above).

  S5 enumerated the **top-level command roots** that don't return "Command not found" on a vanilla ST 10 (`rhino`) running `27.0.6.46330.5043500`:

  ```
  key
  net
  sys
  getpdo
  ```

  Notably absent from that probe: `network`, `envswitch`, `scm`, `ws`, `swupdate`, `remote_services`, `local_services`, `demo`, `mode`, `help`. **However**, other captures on the same firmware family (S6, ST 20 / Wave III / Wave IV) accept `envswitch …`, suggesting either per-model variation in the shipped command table or an SSH/role gate the S5 author didn't trip. Implementations that use `envswitch` should treat its absence as a recoverable preflight outcome (we already do).

  `net` is observed as a valid root by S5 but its sub-commands aren't enumerated; it may be a shorthand alias for `network` on FW 27.x ST 10.

## What we use during migration

For quick reference, the exact sequence our `pkg/service/setup.migrateViaTelnet` issues, all on the same connection, in this order:

```
sys configuration bmxRegistryUrl <serverURL>/bmx/registry/v1/services
sys configuration statsServerUrl <serverURL>
sys configuration margeServerUrl <serverURL>
sys configuration swUpdateUrl    <serverURL>/updates/soundtouch
envswitch boseurls set <serverURL> <serverURL>/updates/soundtouch
getpdo CurrentSystemConfiguration
```

Plus, when pairing a fresh device whose `:8090/setMargeAccount` is missing or wedged, the helper falls back to:

```
envswitch accountid set <7-digit-id>
```

Reboot is **not** part of these sequences — it stays a user-initiated action via the existing reboot button, which now accepts `?method=telnet|ssh` and sends `sys reboot` when telnet is picked.

## What we use to enable SSH (`setup enable-ssh`, #471)

To open SSH on a speaker that has never had it (no USB recovery), the CLI abuses the boseurls value as a command-injection vehicle: when the device next parses it, the appended shell snippet touches the `remote_services` marker and starts `sshd`. The injected suffix is:

```
;touch /tmp/remote_services;/etc/init.d/sshd start
```

**Default path** (`soundtouch-cli setup enable-ssh`) writes that injection only via the persistence layer, then waits for `:22`:

```
envswitch boseurls set "<serverURL>;touch /tmp/remote_services;/etc/init.d/sshd start" "<serverURL>/update"
```

This is field-confirmed on the Wireless Link Adapter and on the CineMate 520 `lisa` variant (FW 27.0.6).

**`--full-config` path** (`soundtouch-cli setup enable-ssh --full-config`) is for devices where the default injection is *accepted and persisted* (`getpdo` confirms the value) but `sshd` never comes up, so `:22` stays "Connection refused". It mirrors the manual telnet sequence @Henri-be confirmed by hand on issue #515: it puts the injection on the runtime `sys configuration margeServerUrl` key as well as `envswitch`, writes all four URL keys, then reboots so the device re-parses the config at boot:

```
sys configuration bmxRegistryUrl "<serverURL>/bmx/registry/v1/services"
sys configuration statsServerUrl "<serverURL>"
sys configuration margeServerUrl "<serverURL>;touch /tmp/remote_services;/etc/init.d/sshd start"
sys configuration swUpdateUrl    "<serverURL>/updates/soundtouch"
envswitch boseurls set "<serverURL>;touch /tmp/remote_services;/etc/init.d/sshd start" "<serverURL>/updates/soundtouch"
getpdo CurrentSystemConfiguration
sys reboot
```

**Which devices need `--full-config`:** observed on the **SoundTouch Portable (Series I, model 412540, FW `27.0.6.46330.5043500`)** (#515) and on some **CineMate 520** units where the default path leaves `sshd` down. The structural differences from the default path that appear to matter are (1) the injection riding `sys configuration margeServerUrl`, not just `envswitch`, and (2) the explicit `sys reboot`. The `--full-config` automation is **candidate behaviour awaiting reporter confirmation** — the manual sequence is confirmed working on the ST Portable, but the flag that automates it has not yet been re-confirmed on hardware. Not every device responds even to the manual sequence (some ST10 and CineMate 520 units never start `sshd` over telnet at all and need the serial / U-Boot route).

**On the `--command-delay` between steps:** originally added because a reporter's back-to-back run left `sshd` down while a ~7s-gapped run succeeded ([#515 comment 5228449448](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5228449448)). That theory was **retracted** by the same reporter after a controlled A/B across three variants showed identical outcomes at 0s and 5s gaps ([comment 5231931569](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5231931569)) — the delay itself doesn't appear to matter. The default is kept small and non-zero (`setup.DefaultTelnetCommandDelay`) as a low-cost hedge for untested variants, not because the delay is known to help.

**The account-pairing precondition** (raised by `Henri-be`, [#515 comment 5230785528](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5230785528), tracing back to [#471 comment 4903016740](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/471#issuecomment-4903016740); confirmed empirically by `bitranox`, [#515 comment 5232241580](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/515#issuecomment-5232241580)): a genuinely unpaired (factory-reset, empty `margeAccountUUID`) device does not poll `margeServerUrl` **at all** — confirmed by pointing a reset device's marge URL at a listener and observing zero requests over 10+ minutes. The SSH-enable injection has no read cycle to fire on until the device is paired. `enable-ssh` handles this automatically by default (`EnsureMargeAccountPaired`, `--no-auto-pair` to skip).

**Factory reset does not remove root access, if it was ever persisted.** Confirmed on a genuinely factory-reset `spotty` ([#471 comment 5232232575](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/471#issuecomment-5232232575)): after the reset, `margeAccountUUID` was empty, all four service URLs were back to `streaming.bose.com`, and presets were gone — but `/etc/remote_services` and `/mnt/nv/remote_services` **survived**, and SSH (:22) and telnet (:17000) stayed open. So once a device has been through `setup enable-ssh` with persistence (`EnsureRemoteServices`, the default), a later factory reset only wipes configuration, not root access — recovery is re-migrate + re-pair + rename + restore presets, with **no USB stick and no re-running the injection**.

**Readiness after a reboot is per-port, not a single moment.** `JRpersonal` first measured that the firmware needs roughly 60s after a cold boot before `:8090`'s `/info` answers and marge state is ready — a booting device answers a bare `HTTP 400` with an empty body before its services are up, which is easy to misread as a rejection rather than "too early" ([#471 comment 5231997551](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/471#issuecomment-5231997551)). `bitranox` refined this across three variants: `:8090` and the diagnostic `:17000` shell (and the config subsystem behind it that `getpdo` reads) do **not** become ready at the same time — waiting for `:8090` and then immediately reading over `:17000` returned an empty response even though the box was otherwise up. Ten observed reboots: down in 2.3–5.3s, ready (able to answer `getpdo` correctly) in 55.1–91.8s, median ~69.8s ([#471 comment 5232046477](https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/issues/471#issuecomment-5232046477)). Anything automated should wait for the specific interface it's about to use, not for a different port to answer first — see the troubleshooting guide's [power-cycle retry note](../guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for the user-facing version of this.

## Out of scope here, but worth recording

- **Setup-mode WiFi onboarding via 192.0.2.1.** The community uses this to add a fresh device to a network without the Bose app. Our `soundtouch-service` does not currently automate this, but `network wifi profiles add` is the entry point if we ever do.
- **Direct preset / playback control via `sys`.** The S4 `bose` script demonstrates a viable headless remote-control path that does not need our marge emulation at all. Useful as a fallback for tooling on devices that refuse to talk to any cloud.
- **`scm restart <service>`.** Not used today, but a possible recovery primitive on older firmware where a stuck service blocks streaming.
