### Detailed Device Control
Individual device pages provide full control over:
- Detailed now-playing information with artwork
- Comprehensive audio controls (volume, bass)
- Full preset and source selection
- Real-time status updates

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Access to SoundTouch devices on the same network
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support

### Building
```bash
# From project root
make build

# Or manually
cd cmd/soundtouch-player
go build -o soundtouch-player
```

### Running
```bash
# Run with default settings (port 8080)
./soundtouch-player

# Specify custom port
./soundtouch-player -port 8888

# Connect to specific device
./soundtouch-player --devices 192.0.2.100
```

### Command Line Options
```
--port, -p string    HTTP port to listen on (default "8080", env PORT)
--bind string        Address for the HTTP listener: host, IP, or interface name (env BIND_ADDR)
--interface string   Network interface name for mDNS/UPnP discovery (env DISCOVERY_INTERFACE)
--devices strings    SoundTouch device IP(s) to add manually, repeatable (env SOUNDTOUCH_DEVICES)
--service-url string AfterTouch service base URL, e.g. https://soundtouch.local (env SERVICE_URL)
--service-ca string  Path to the AfterTouch service CA certificate (PEM) to trust (env SERVICE_CA)
--help, -h           Show help information
```

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

TTS synthesis and the Bose `app_key` live in the AfterTouch service, not in
soundtouch-player, so the "Speak" feature proxies to the service's
`/setup/tts/speak` endpoint. To use it, point soundtouch-player at the service
with `--service-url`.

When the service is served over HTTPS with its own self-signed certificate
(the default), soundtouch-player also needs to trust the service's CA, or the
proxied call fails with `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`. Pass
the CA with `--service-ca`; it is the service's `<dataDir>/certs/ca.crt`:

```bash
soundtouch-player \
  --service-url https://soundtouch.fritz.box \
  --service-ca /path/to/certs/ca.crt
```

The CA is appended to the system trust store, so a service URL that uses a
publicly trusted certificate keeps working without the flag. The target
speaker must be known to the service (it resolves the speaker against its own
device datastore).

## Usage

### Accessing the Interface
1. Start the application
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Click "Discover Devices" to find SoundTouch devices on your network
4. Click on any device for detailed control, or use quick controls from the main page

### Device Discovery
The application automatically discovers SoundTouch devices using:
- **mDNS discovery** for local network devices
- **UPnP/SSDP discovery** as fallback
- **Configured devices** via `--devices`, retried whenever discovery runs

### Real-time Updates
The interface maintains WebSocket connections to each device for instant updates of:
- Now playing information and artwork
- Volume and audio settings changes
- Playback status (play/pause/stop)
- Connection status and device health

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full-featured interface with side-by-side panels
- **Tablet**: Optimized layout with touch-friendly controls
- **Mobile**: Stacked interface with gesture support

## API Endpoints

The web UI exposes a REST API for programmatic control:

### Device Management
```
GET  /api/devices           # List all discovered devices
GET  /api/device/{id}       # Get specific device info
POST /api/discover          # Trigger device discovery
```

### Device Control
```
GET  /api/control/{id}/play        # Start playback
GET  /api/control/{id}/pause       # Pause playback
GET  /api/control/{id}/stop        # Stop playback
GET  /api/control/{id}/next        # Next track
GET  /api/control/{id}/previous    # Previous track
POST /api/control/{id}/volume      # Set volume (body: {"level": 50})
GET  /api/control/{id}/mute        # Mute audio
GET  /api/control/{id}/unmute      # Unmute audio
POST /api/control/{id}/bass        # Set bass (body: {"level": 0})
GET  /api/control/{id}/preset?id=1 # Select preset
GET  /api/control/{id}/source?name=SPOTIFY # Select source
```

### WebSocket Events
Connect to `/ws` for real-time updates:
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ws');
ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // Handle device updates, status changes, etc.
};
```

## Architecture

### Single-Page Application Architecture
- **JSON API Backend**: Go server providing RESTful endpoints
- **Client-Side Rendering**: JavaScript handles all UI rendering

## Security Considerations

- **Local Network Only**: Designed for local network device control
- **No Authentication**: Assumes trusted local network environment
- **CORS Policy**: Restricted to same-origin requests
- **WebSocket Security**: Uses same-origin WebSocket connections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Devices Not Found**
- Ensure devices are on the same network
- Check firewall settings (ports 8090, 8080)
- Click "Discover Devices" button to trigger discovery

**WebSocket Connection Failed**
- Verify device supports WebSocket connections
- Check browser console for connection errors
- Refresh the page to reconnect WebSocket

**Control Commands Not Working**
- Check device is powered on and connected
- Verify device is not in exclusive mode (e.g., Spotify Connect active)
- Look for error notifications in the UI

**Page Shows Template Errors**
- This has been fixed in the SPA implementation
- Ensure you're accessing the correct URL (localhost:8080)
- Clear browser cache if you see old template-based content

### Debug Mode
Add verbose logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
./soundtouch-player
```
