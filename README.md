## The Bose Cloud Has Shut Down

Bose shut down SoundTouch cloud services on **May 6, 2026**. Presets, music service browsing, and stereo pairing no longer work through Bose's infrastructure. AfterTouch restores all of these — no Bose infrastructure required.

See the [Survival Guide](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/guides/SURVIVAL-GUIDE/) for the full picture, or jump straight to [Downloads](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/downloads/) to get the tools.

## Tools

### soundtouch-service — AfterTouch

A local server that replaces the Bose cloud ("AfterTouch"). Once your speaker is redirected to it, you have full control without any Bose cloud dependency. The built-in web UI at `http://localhost:8000` handles all setup — no config files needed to get started.

Not sure which approach fits your situation? See the [Deployment Overview](./docs/content/docs/guides/DEPLOYMENT-OVERVIEW.md) — it compares running AfterTouch on a Raspberry Pi or other always-on host against running it directly on the SoundTouch speaker, with links to step-by-step walkthroughs for each path.

**Getting started:**

**Already migrated before May 6** — your presets and credentials are preserved. AfterTouch picks up where the Bose cloud left off.

**Starting fresh (or after a factory reset)** — create a local account, configure your speakers, and start using them immediately.

**Redirecting your speaker**

The service needs a stable address on your local network (e.g. `soundtouch.fritz.box` or `soundtouch.local`). The speaker must then be redirected to resolve the Bose cloud hostnames to that address. Two supported methods:

| Method       | How it works                        | Notes                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| XML redirect | Upload a config XML via the Web API | Surgical; covers only registered endpoints; best for testing |
| DNS/DHCP     | Serve custom DNS on your network    | Covers all devices at once; requires port 53 and TLS         |

The web UI walks you through each method. DNS redirect requires HTTPS — the service manages its own CA certificate and the web UI guides you through trusting it on each speaker.

> **Note:** A hosts-file method (direct SSH edits to `/etc/hosts`) also exists in the codebase but is deprecated and not exposed in the web UI.

**Enabling SSH via USB stick**

Some setup steps require SSH access to the speaker. Enable it once per device: create a file named `remote_services` on a FAT-formatted USB drive (the drive may need its bootable flag set — see [SoundCork issue #172](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues/172)), and insert it while the speaker is powered on. After reboot, root SSH is available with no password.

See [Device Initial Setup](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/guides/DEVICE-INITIAL-SETUP/) and [Migration Guide](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/guides/MIGRATION-GUIDE/) for step-by-step instructions.

---

### soundtouch-backup

Backs up your Bose cloud account (presets, paired devices, music sources) and each speaker's local state before the shutdown. Run `soundtouch-backup all` to capture everything in one step; it authenticates with the Bose cloud, then polls each paired speaker over the local network.

See the [soundtouch-backup README](cmd/soundtouch-backup/README.md) for usage.

---

### soundtouch-cli

Command-line control of any SoundTouch device: play/pause/volume, presets, source selection, multiroom zones, device discovery, and more. Works entirely over the local network — no cloud dependency. Well-suited for scripting and home automation.

See the [CLI Reference](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/guides/CLI-REFERENCE/) for full usage, and the [Downloads page](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/downloads/) to get the `soundtouch-cli` build for your OS.

---

### soundtouch-player

> Formerly `soundtouch-web`. The `soundtouch-web` binary, Docker image, and install script are no longer published; please use `soundtouch-player`. (If you still run the binary under its old name, it prints a rename notice and works as before.)

A standalone, LAN-resident web UI for device control — play, pause, volume, preset selection, real-time status — served from a local Go binary. Because it reaches speakers directly on your network and can delegate cloud-only features (e.g. TTS) to a remote AfterTouch service via `--service-url`, it stays useful when `soundtouch-service` runs off-LAN (for example in the cloud), where the embedded `/app` player cannot reach your speakers.

See the [soundtouch-player README](cmd/soundtouch-player/README.md) for usage.

---

### Go library

`pkg/client` provides a Go API for all SoundTouch device endpoints: media control, volume, presets, sources, zones, real-time WebSocket events, and device discovery. Use it to build your own integrations.

```
go get github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch
```

See the [API Reference](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/docs/reference/API-ENDPOINTS/) and [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch) for documentation.
